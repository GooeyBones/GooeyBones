- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is David Austin and I'm fresh to the software development/ computer programming line of work.

- ðŸ‘€ In my free time, you'll find me working on something artistic. Recently, I've been dabbling in Blender and Unity to bring some characters to life in VRChat!
If I play a game, it's usually some sort of sim like Cities Skylines or Mechwarrior.

- ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm neck deep in studying Web Development and Visual Basic. I've also dipped my toes into the world of Discord bots, learning alot about
node and API's along the way.
